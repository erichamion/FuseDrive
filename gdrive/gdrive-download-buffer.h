/*
 * gdrive_dlbuf_create():   Creates a new Gdrive_Download_Buffer struct. Once 
 *                          this struct is no longer needed, the caller should
 *                          call gdrive_dlbuf_free().
 * Parameters:
 *      initialSize (size_t):
 *              The in-memory buffer will be initially allocated with a size
 *              of initialSize bytes. The buffer will grow dynamically as needed
 *              so this is not a limitation on the size of downloaded data. If
 *              a file handle is given in the fh parameter, then initialSize is
 *              recommended to be 0.
 *      fh (FILE*):
 *              If fh is NULL, the downloaded data will be stored in an 
 *              in-memory buffer. Otherwise, it will be written to the stream
 *              specified by this parameter.
 * Return value (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *      NULL on error, or a pointer to a newly allocated Gdrive_Download_Buffer
 *      struct on success.

 *                      stream, does NOT close the stream.
 * Parameters:
 *      pBuf (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *              A pointer to the struct to be freed. This pointer should no 
 *              longer be used after the function returns.

 * Return value (long):
 *      The HTTP status code for the last transfer done using pBuf. If pBuf has

 *                          in-memory buffer was used.
 * Parameters:
 *      pBuf (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *              A pointer to the download buffer that performed the transfer.
 * Return value (const char*):
 *      The location of the in-memory buffer that holds the contents of the last
 *      download using pBuf. If pBuf has not completed a transfer or used a
 *      FILE* stream, the return value is undefined. Note: The memory pointed

/*
 * gdrive_dlbuf_download(): Perform a transfer and store the result as either
 *                          an in-memory buffer or a FILE* stream.
 * Parameters:
 *      pBuf (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *              The download buffer to use for storing the results of the 
 *              transfer. If pBuf was created with a FILE* handle, then the 
 *              downloaded data will be written to that stream. Otherwise, it
 *              will be stored in an in-memory buffer, which can be retrieved
 *              with gdrive_dlbuf_get_data().
 * Return value (CURLcode):
 *      Returns the success or failure of the transfer, as reported by curl.
 *      Success is indicated by CURLE_OK. See libcurl documentation for possible
 *      error values.

 *                                      errors. Optionally, refreshes auth

 *                                      authentication errors.
 * Parameters:

 *              A pointer to a Gdrive_Download_Buffer struct that will be used
 *              to store the results of the download.
 *      retryOnAuthError (bool):
 *              Determines whether to renew authorization and retry on
 *              authentication failure.
 *      tryNum (int):
 *              Reserved for internal use. Must be 0.
 *      maxTries (int):
 *              Maximum number of attempts before finally failing.
 * Return value (int):
 *      0 on success, other on failure.
